# Project Documentation and Specification

## Introduction
+ Brief description of the project and its operations/features

## Project Scope
+ Problem statement and the solutions (high level : project objective and scope)
+ Scope of operations and features
+ Acknowledgments 

## Design 
+ list of operations and features planned (python library, datacube objects, operations, e.g. access, subset, process, aggregate, fusion, encode and graph…
+ Implementation Schedule and Plan
  - Sprint#1 :Define project scope, project plan and project design and setup the environment with some sample functions, source codes and test cases (8 April - 18 April, 2 weeks)
  - Sprint#2 :Implement the operations and features and perform unit testing (19 April - 2 May, 2 weeks)
  - SPrint#3 :Implement the rest of the operations and features, perform unit and integration testing and rollout the system (3 May - 16 May, 2 weeks)

+ Technical details:
  - software tools and systems:
    - Python
    - WCPS of the rasdaman datacube and database object 
+ Test Plan :
  - Unit Testing : test the units of operations and features with test cases and expected test results 
  - Integration Test : test the whole system with the integration test cases after integrated all units of operations and features
