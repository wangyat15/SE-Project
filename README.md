# Project Specification and Documentation

## Introduction
This project utlilizes [Python](https://www.python.org/) to generate and visualize spatio-temporal earth data using a transparent [WCPS](https://earthserver.eu/wcs/) query from the [Rasdaman Datacube](https://standards.rasdaman.com/), a multi-dimensional array database. It showcases the processing of datacube objects through a range of WCPS operations and functions.  The project is implmented in a traditional software development life cycle including specification, implementation, testing, integration and documentation. The project emphasizes collaboration and teamwork accross sprint cycles to achieve the planned outcomes. 

## Project Scope
+ Problem statement and the solutions (high level : project objective and scope)
+ Scope of operations and features
+ Acknowledgments 

## Design 
+ list of operations and features planned (python library, datacube objects, operations, e.g. access, subset, process, aggregate, fusion, encode and graph…
+ Implementation Schedule and Plan
  - Sprint#1(8 April to 18 April , 2 weeks):
    Define project scope, project plan and project design and setup the environment with some sample functions, source codes and test cases
  - Sprint#2(19 April to 2 May, 2 weeks):
    Implement the operations and features and perform unit testing 
  - SPrint#3(3 May to 16 May, 2 weeks) :
    Implement the rest of the operations and features, perform unit and integration testing and rollout the system 

+ Technical details:
  - software tools and systems:
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - [WCPS (Web Coverage Processing Service)](https://earthserver.eu/wcs/) of the [Rasdaman Datacube and query language](https://standards.rasdaman.com/) 
    - [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) (for testing and training materials)
    - [GitHub](https://github.com/) (for source repository)
+ Test Plan :
  - Unit Testing : test the units of each operation and each feature with test cases and expected test results 
  - Integration Test : test the whole system with the integration test cases after integrated all units of operations and features
